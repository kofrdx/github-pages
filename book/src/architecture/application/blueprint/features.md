> **_NOTE:_** Features are currently only available for use by native packages.
 
Features provide a mechanism to express conditional execution and conditional stored state
(using [Field Conditions](fields.md#field-condition)). The set of features to be used are specified
[per object](../object/features.md) on instantiation.

Features are identified by string.
