# Generics

> **_NOTE:_** Generics are currently only available for use by native packages.

Generics to a blueprint requires an object instantiator to specify [generic substitutions](../object/generic_substitutions.md)
during instantiation. Such a generic can then be used in defining function or state schemas.

Generics in a Blueprint are identified by index.
