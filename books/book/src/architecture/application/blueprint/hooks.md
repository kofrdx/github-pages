# Hooks

> **_NOTE:_** Hooks are currently only available for use by native packages.
 
Hooks define logic which get executed when certain system events occur.

There are currently three types of hooks:

| Hook Name    | Description                                                                      |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
