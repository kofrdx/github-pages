# Functions/Methods

Functions/Methods define executable logic. A function is executable logic which does not directly
depend on the internal state of an object. A method is executable logic which directly depends
on internal state of an object, known as *receiver*.

Every function/method is defined by an input/output schema which describes the signature of the
function/method.

Functions/Methods are identified by string.
