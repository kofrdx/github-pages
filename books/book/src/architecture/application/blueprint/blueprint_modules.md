# Blueprint Modules

The system may define additional state to be stored per blueprint known as Blueprint modules. If defined, 
every blueprint definition must initialize these modules.

Currently there exists two blueprint modules:
* [Auth Blueprint Module](../../../native/auth/blueprint_module.md)
* [Package Royalties Blueprint Module](../../../native/royalties/package_royalties.md)
